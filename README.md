# global-counter

A quick project I'm developping with the Tapirus Primus to get myself in the groove and make an actual project.

## Goals
On June 27th, have a simple website where you have a button and a counter.
When you press the button, it should update the counter for every single client.

## Specifications:
- Backend in Python/Flask
- Frontend in JS/Angular

## Software Craftsmanship goals
- Using a git repository with atomic commits
- Using a virtual environemnt for python
- Document all code
